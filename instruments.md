## Subjective Cognitive Load Items

We adapted a a questionnaire developed by [Berthold and Renkl (2009)](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/101/1/70/) on subjective cognitive load. We used a 5-point Likert scale for each question.

* How easy or difficult was it for you to revise your text?
* How easy or difficult was it for you to work with the software?
* How easy or difficult was it for you to distinguish important and unimportant information from the feedback?
* How easy or difficult was it for you to collect all the information that you need to improve your text?
* How easy or difficult was it for you to identify cohesion gaps in your text from the feedback?
* What makes the feedback particularly easy or difficult?

## Coherence Questionnaire

Before subjects wrote their first text we asked them to fill out a questionnaire strategies that influence text cohesion. We used a 5 point Likert Scale:

> You you see 12 statements about different strategies that influence text comprehension. Please indicate how much these strategies improve the understanding of a text.

> The understanding of a text can be improved by ...

| item number | item |
| --- | --- |
| coherence.00 | including connectives that relate sentences logically (and, because, when). | 
| coherence.01 | using sentences with a similar sentence structure within a text. |
| coherence.02 | including temporal connectives (then, after that). |
| coherence.03 | structuring a text with headings. |
| coherence.04 | repetition of nouns that were previously introduced. |
| coherence.05 | sticking to the temporal sequence of a topic. |
| coherence.06 | including paragraphs. |
| coherence.07 | using a variety of creative topic sentences. |
| coherence.08 | using many synonyms. |
| coherence.09 | explicit reference of related text sections. |
| coherence.10 | including word repetitions. |
| coherence.11 | sticking to the logical structure of a topic. |

## Global coherence rubric

Two independent raters calculated global coherence by the following rubric. 

| No orientation | complete orientation | 0 = not apparent, 0.5 = somewhat apparent, 1 = clearly apparent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Superordinate concepts and princples are not stated | Superordinate concepts and principles are stated | |
| Basic concepts and principles are not stated | Basic concepts and principles are stated |  |
| Connections between basic concepts are not stated | Connections between basic concepts are stated | |
| Subordinate concepts are not stated | Subordinate concepts are stated | | 

Global cohesion was calculated by the sum all three points.
