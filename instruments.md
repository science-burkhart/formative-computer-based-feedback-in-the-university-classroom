## Subjective Cognitive Load Items

We adapted a a questionnaire developed by [Berthold and Renkl (2009)](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/101/1/70/) on subjective cognitive load. We used a 5-point Likert scale for each question.

* How easy or difficult do you consider ... at this moment?
* How easy or difficult is it for you to work with the learning environment?
* How easy or difficult is it for you to distinguish important and unimportant information in the learning environment?
* How easy or difficult is it for you to collect all the information that you need in the learning environment?
* Indicate on the scale the amount or effort you invested to understand the task?
