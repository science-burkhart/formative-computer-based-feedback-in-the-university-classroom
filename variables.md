# Variables

| variable  | explanation  |
|---|---|
| subject  | For every subject we generated a unique six digit string (e.g. `GpvAij`)  |
| condition  |  We assigned subjects to three different feedback conditions. (0) Subjects that received a **general textual** feedback indicating that they should improve their texts coherence; (1) An **outline feedback** that represented lists of words that were related to another in the text; (2) A **concept mapt feedback**  that visualized related words in [clusters](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/950642).|
| age | The age of each subject. |
