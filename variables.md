# Variables


| variable  | explanation  |
|---|---|
| subject  | For every subject we generated a unique six digit string (e.g. `GpvAij`)  |
| condition  |  We assigned subjects to three different feedback conditions. (0) Subjects that received a **general textual** feedback indicating that they should improve their texts coherence; (1) An **outline feedback** that represented lists of words that were related to another in the text; (2) A **concept mapt feedback**  that visualized related words in [clusters](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/950642).|
| age | The age of each subject. |
| gender  | The subjects gender. 0 == male, 1 == female.  |
| university.semester  | The number of semesters subjects had been matriculated at university.  |
| internship  | The subjects were enrolled in the teacher education program at the University of Freiburg. As part of their program they are supposed to complete an [internship ](https://www.zfs.uni-freiburg.de/studium/osp) at school at the beginning of their studies. 0 indicates that they have not completed the internship, whereas 1 indicates that they did. |
| courseofstudy | The course of study the subjects were enrolled in. Every subject was enrolled for the teacher education program.  |
| subject.semester  | The number of semesters a students was matriculated for teacher training at university.  |

| teaching.experience | We asked subjects to estimate their prior teaching experience on a scale ranging form 0 to 4 (no experience vs. a lot of experience) |
| cognitive.load | After subjects wrote their first text we handed out a [questionnaire](instruments.md) on their subjective cognitive load developed by [Berthold and Renkl (2009)](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/101/1/70/).|
| cognitive.load.234 | Mean of cognitive load items 2 to 4. |
| orientation.diagnostik.pre | Subjects had to write instructional explanations on three topics discussed in previous lectures. One of those texts dealt with teaching diagnostics. We handcoded  | 
| orientation.diagnostic.post | |
| explanations.orientierung.pre | |
| explanations.orientierung.post | |
| global.diagnostic.diff | The change in global cohesion between the revised text on teachers' diagnostics and the original text (`orientation.diagnostik.post` - `orientation.diagnostik.pre`) |
